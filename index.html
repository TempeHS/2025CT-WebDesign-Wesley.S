    <h1>Playstation or Xbox?</h1>

    <p1>In the battle of the spec sheets, the PS5 appears to lose out against the Xbox Series X. Both have 8-core
        CPUs from AMD,
        but the Xbox's are clocked at 3.8GHz while the PS5's are 3.5GHz. Both consoles also use AMD graphics processors,
        with
        the Xbox's providing 12 teraflops of power to the PS5's 10.28 teraflops</p1>

        <p2>This image is a graph of all the qualities the PS5 and Xbox Series X have</p2>
        <p3>As you can see the Xbox Series X massively outranks the PS5 in all qualities including GPU
            CPU, Storage, and all other important aspects
        </p3>
        <p4>Considering they are the same price of $750 it isn't even a debate about which is better at computing
            so if you are going for raw power the Xbox Series X is by far the best option
            But this is where the Xbox stops
        </p4>
        <p5>The PS5 may be slightly weaker in terms of comuting power however its interface makes up for it
            The user friendlyness the PS5 has is unmatched and is the easiest console to navigate,
            The PS5 has shortcuts everywhere and easiest to understand settings and is the best console for new gamers
